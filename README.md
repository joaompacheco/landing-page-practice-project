## My process

To build this page I resorted to the concepts that I have already consolidated CSS and attended some classes of the online course I am doing at the moment called "DEVQUEST". The course has helped me a lot to understand concepts that was with many doubts such as: flex display and display grid. Researching MDN documentation has helped me a lot to understand the workings of the elements in CSS.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Display Flex
- Display Grid

### What I learned

With this project I managed to get a general idea of how is the process of designing until the development of a page, I am very excited to learn JavaScript to be able to create more elaborate sites yet, that's my goal. I also intend to develop more of my design skills.

### Continued development

My objetive is continue building more and more projects with new concepts and technologies.
